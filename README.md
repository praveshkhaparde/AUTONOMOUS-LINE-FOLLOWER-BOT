## AUTONOMOUS LINE-FOLLOWER BOT | COURSE PROJECT

**Course Project | Prof. Joseph John**  
*Jan’23 – Feb’23*

- Aimed to build a line-following robot using IR sensors, an L298 motor driver, and an Arduino Uno R3  
- Achieved autonomous line tracking and simultaneous black line detection using two IR sensors in the bot  
- Implemented obstacle detection for autonomous retrieval using an ultrasonic sensor and precise IR placement
